        <p>People often ask me why I leave my ountry to study abroad. This had me thinking for quite some time and what I have realized is travelling allows me to discover what I long for while teaching me what to be grateful for. It allos me to learn from the environmentthat surrounds me and the people that occupy it. I want to experience culture, I want to understand a world outside of my own and I want to do it through my own eyes, not through another person, photograph or article. I want to make my own experiences whether good or bad and I want to one day return to my home and be able to say, when I was 18 I left my comfort zone and followed my dreams and it was the best choice I ever made.</p>

            <p>Happiness is a mentality and it is the sole purpose I search for in my life. Happiness is specific to each individual, some see happiness in family, the job they work at or the place they live. What I define happiness as, stepping back and looking at your life and being able to say, I have no regrets, I never gave up, I set my goals and I reached them or if not I tried. It is finding the beauty in places around me and its never selling myself short of the capabilities this life has to offer me.</p>
