        <p>People often ask me why I leave my ountry to study abroad. This had me thinking for quite some time and what I have realized is travelling allows me to discover what I long for while teaching me what to be grateful for. It allos me to learn from the environmentthat surrounds me and the people that occupy it. I want to experience culture, I want to understand a world outside of my own and I want to do it through my own eyes, not through another person, photograph or article. I want to make my own experiences whether good or bad and I want to one day return to my home and be able to say, when I was 18 I left my comfort zone and followed my dreams and it was the best choice I ever made.</p>
