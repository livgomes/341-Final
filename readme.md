# MART-341 WEB DEVELOPMENT
## Final Project
### 1. Summary


# Content Idea

**Website Theme**- I chose to do a personal website that I can use to portray three major themes; personal blogs, travel blogs and photography. This content or structure may change once I begin the process of actully putting my website together and working with the content I will want to use.

**Website Content**- For the website content I plan on the majority of the content to directly from by me, whether it is my story or photgraphy. However I may choose to link other blogs or insirational finding, as I see fit. This again may change as my project progresses.

**Process**- The process I belive I will be taking to do build the main layout of my website as best as I can first, adding certain titles or images I plan to use and then go back and add content along the way, during or after. This is something I found to be quite helpful and worked well for me throughtout the semester.

# Layout

I have not fully designed my lay out for my webpage just as yet, however I do have an idea of what I will want it to look like. I will like to allow my entire webpage work as a RWD, and will like to have the main page create a four main squre boexs that are laid out in a two by two column and row, at which each box with a link that represent; Perso Bio, Blog, Travels and Photography. These links will lead to sub-webpages designed to meet the theme of each pager. I hope for the blog page to appear quite simple with an airey feel to it, few pictures, simple font and light, soft colours. For the travels page I will like to play with some form or Parallax scrolling. For the photography page I am ot sure how I will like it but I may keep it simple or in a grid form that once the mouse passes over the picture will cause the picture to pop up to wide screen.

**NOTE** This is just a quick and breif idea of how I would like my website to look and the content I choose to use, I may change things as I work with them depending how they fit together or my ability to create the content and layout the way that I have invisioned.


### Colour Pallette
The colour pallette that I have choosen in light blue, violet and greys. I wanted to used soft lighter colours that will create a more relxed feel and not distract from the content within the webpage.
